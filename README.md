# DRIFTLY

Driftly is a web app that humorously suggests the best destinations for digital nomads depending on real-time weather conditions. By mimicking a travel agency, Driftly exaggerates the marketing discourse of digital nomad hubs. As a result, remote, or lesser-known places are recommended.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** Vue.js
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express, Axios (API requests)
- **API:** OpenWeather (real-time weather updates)
- **Responsive Design:** Works across all devices
